# Draughts-Qt
Simple Draughts game made with Qt. Game mostly follows russian variant of the rules ("shashki").

Started mostly as learning and experimenting with Qt. Program quickly become more complex than anticipated.
Some earlier parts of the code were written long ago in basic C++98 and mostly don't follow principles of OOP.
My attempt on merging this into Qt program created a lot of issues and problems in some parts of the code.
Particularly in game mechanics part and move legality checks. Now these parts need to be revised so program will follow object-oriented approach.
Some minor details, like pieces jump back as kings during chain of jumps are not implemented yet.
